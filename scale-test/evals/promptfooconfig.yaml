      ground_truth_description: |
        Multiple Lambda functions are being reduced from a 3-second to a 1-second timeout 
        while they interact with SQS and S3. At 1 second, cold starts, network latency,

        be terminated by Lambda before cleanup or DeleteMessage can occur.
        
        When these functions time out, SQS messages remain invisible until the queue's 
        VisibilityTimeout expires, then are retried, causing duplicate deliveries, backlogs, 
        and DLQ traffic. In-flight S3/HTTP calls will be aborted, surfacing as 5xx/timeouts.

          EVALUATION CRITERIA:
          1. Does at least ONE detected risk semantically match the expected risk?
             - It should identify Lambda timeout reduction
             - It should mention consequences (retries, failures, SQS issues, etc.)
             - Exact wording is NOT required - semantic similarity counts
          
          2. Is the severity appropriate? (medium or higher is acceptable)
          
          3. IGNORE any additional risks - they may be from other infrastructure changes.
             Only check if the EXPECTED risk is present.
          
          Score 1 if the expected Lambda timeout risk is detected with appropriate severity.
          Score 0 if the expected risk is missing or severity is too low (e.g., "low" for this scenario).

          The combined_max scenario is the most severe: it opens ALL ports (0-65535)
