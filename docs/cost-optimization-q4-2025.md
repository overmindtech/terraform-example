# Q4 2025 Cost Optimization Analysis

## Memory Optimization Opportunity

### Current State
- **Container Memory**: 2048MB per container
- **Container Count**: 15 containers
- **Monthly Cost**: $3,000 (15 × 2GB × $100/GB/month)
- **Annual Cost**: $36,000

### Monitoring Analysis
Our monitoring shows:
- **Average Memory Usage**: 800MB per container
- **Peak Usage**: 1.2GB during traffic spikes
- **Utilization**: Only 39% of allocated memory being used

### Proposed Optimization
- **New Container Memory**: 1024MB per container (50% reduction)
- **Safety Buffer**: 1024MB - 800MB = 224MB headroom
- **New Monthly Cost**: $1,500 (15 × 1GB × $100/GB/month)
- **Annual Savings**: $18,000 (50% reduction)

### Business Justification
- CFO mandate for Q4 cost reductions
- Black Friday prep: need budget for scaling compute
- Low risk: monitoring shows plenty of headroom
- Easy rollback if any issues arise

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Deploy to staging environment
- **Week 2**: Monitor performance metrics
- **Week 3**: Deploy to production (7 days before Black Friday)
- **Black Friday**: Monitor during peak traffic

## Risk Assessment: LOW
✅ Monitoring shows low memory usage  
✅ 224MB safety buffer provided  
✅ Can rollback quickly if needed  
✅ Staging environment testing planned  
✅ Perfect timing before cost reporting deadline
