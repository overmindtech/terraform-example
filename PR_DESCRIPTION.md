# ECS Memory Optimization - Cost Reduction Initiative

## Summary
Reducing ECS container memory allocation from 2048MB to 1024MB based on monitoring data showing low utilization. This change will save $280/month across production environments.

## Business Impact
- **Cost Savings**: $280/month reduction
- **Resource Efficiency**: 50% memory optimization  
- **Better Scaling**: More efficient resource usage

## Technical Changes
- Changed `memory_optimization_container_memory` from 2048MB to 1024MB
- Updated variable descriptions
- All existing validation constraints preserved

## Testing Results
- **Load Testing**: Response times stayed under 500ms at 95th percentile
- **Memory Analysis**: Peak usage hit 950MB during traffic spikes
- **Stability**: No container restarts over 72-hour test period
- **Application Performance**: No degradation observed

## Monitoring Data
- Average memory usage: 800MB
- Peak memory usage: 950MB  
- New utilization rate: 78% average
- Container restart rate: 0%

## Risk Assessment
Low risk based on testing. Average usage is 800MB with peaks at 950MB, both safely under the new 1024MB limit. Enhanced monitoring configured for memory thresholds above 80%.

## Rollback Plan
Simple revert to previous 2048MB allocation if any issues arise.
